## My process

### Built with


- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- GIT
- State management(useContext API)
- REACT HOOKS


### What I learned

This is my first project using the REACT js library. I learnt how to use props and components, 
also managed my states using the useContext API and other hooks lke useState and useEffect.

I also praticed my SASS skills more where i used mixins, variables, nesting and  patios.

### Continued development

In future projects, i will be focusing more on effective state management and pratice state managers like the REDUX,
write more semantically correct html
